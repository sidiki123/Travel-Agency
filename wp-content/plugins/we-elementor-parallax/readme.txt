== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can I change z-index of layers ?**

Yes, you can change z-index of layer by sorting them, the first is send to back, the last, to front.

**Can I add text or others widgets on a parallax element ?**

You can user the Elementor 2.5.0 absolute positionning, but it's not well optimized.
Please wait a new version with this functionnality :)

**Editor is "laggy" with Elementor Parallax**

If you use too much layers, you can experience some performances issues.
Try to choose lighter images, and reduce layers number.
Keep at mind that the final view is more fluid than the editor view.
